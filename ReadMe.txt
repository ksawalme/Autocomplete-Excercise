Hey guys this exercise goal is to bring together all that you learned so far.

The exercise has two main Objectives:-
1- Using the index.html page users should be able to submit their names as new records in SQL database.
2-Using the search bar in the index.html page, users can query the database dynamically as they type in the search bar. Similar to the autocomplete feature found in Amazon.com search bar.

I know it may seems daunting at the beginning but remember if it's too big or too complex just break it down to smaller pieces.


Ps: The layout of the index.html relays on bootstrap CDN. So the page may look different if you don't have internet connection when you view it.
